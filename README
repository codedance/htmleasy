Tips for developers working on Htmleasy

 * Make sure Maven is installed.

 * Running "mvn package" in this directory will download dependencies and
   build the JAR.

 * You can open this project in Eclipse (run an "mvn compile" to ensure 
   the dependencies are downloaded.)

 * Try to remain consistent with coding conventions (TODO: Document).

 * Stay true to the project's goals (TODO: Document). Propose any largish
   changes on the discussion forum first.

Push any questions through the discussion group, or emails the developers
offline as appropriate:
